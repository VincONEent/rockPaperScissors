# rockPaperScissors


In this project the goal is to create a rock paper cissors game in console.
between a player and the computer.
The first layer of completion is to get a single round of the game working,
the "extra credit" option is to set up a best of 5 between the player and the computer.


The project is done, the easiest improve to add is an error gestion, as of right now an incorrect entry from the player would cause the
entire program to crash, but it wasn't required to be that thorough in this project as it is only an introduction to java, not a project supposed to endure
stress.
